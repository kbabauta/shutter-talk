# Welcome to Shutter Talk

A forum app designed with React for like-minded photographers of all levels to discuss concepts, work, and gain insightful critcism.

As a casual photographer, I wanted to create a space where others could come together and discuss, whether they are a hobbyist or professional, Shutter Talk is a place for the community to come together.
